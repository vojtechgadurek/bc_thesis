abstract = {It is possible to use a small counter to keep approximate counts of large numbers. The resulting expected error can be rather precisely controlled. An example is given in which 8-bit counters (bytes) are used to keep track of as many as 130,000 events with a relative error which is substantially independent of the number n of events. This relative error can be expected to be 24 percent or less 95 percent of the time (i.e. σ = n/8). The techniques could be used to advantage in multichannel counting hardware or software used for the monitoring of experiments or processes.},

	abstract = {The exponential growth of genome databases calls for novel space-efficient algorithms for data compression and search. State-of-the-art approaches often rely on k-merization for data tokenization, yet efficiently representing and querying k-mer sets remains a significant challenge in bioinformatics. Our recent work has introduced the concept of masked superstring for compactly representing k-mer sets, designed without reliance on common structural assumptions on k-mer data. However, despite their compactness, the practicality of masked superstrings for set operations and membership queries was previously unclear. Here, we propose the f-masked superstring framework, which additionally integrates demasking functions f, enabling efficient k-mer set operations through concatenation. When combined with the FMS-index, a new index for f-masked superstrings based on a simplified FM-index, we obtain a versatile, compact data structure for k-mer sets. We demonstrate its power through the FMSI program, which, when evaluated on bacterial pan-genomic data, achieves memory savings of a factor of 3 to 10 compared to state-of-the-art single k-mer-set indexing methods such as SBWT and CBL. Our work presents a theoretical framework with promising practical advantages such as space-efficiency, demonstrating the potential of f-masked superstrings in k-mer-based methods as a generic data type.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
